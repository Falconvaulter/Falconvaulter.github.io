<h1>CURE International</h1>
<p>
    During the Spring of 2015 I interned with CURE International.
    An organization that works with third world contries to deliver
    medical care.

    While at CURE, I worked on a module for their offline first app, HospitalRun. 
    I helped develop the Ministry module to track events, people and allow for
    for simple streamlined reporting of this information. We worked with Node.js,
    Ember Js, Bootstrap and CouchDB.
