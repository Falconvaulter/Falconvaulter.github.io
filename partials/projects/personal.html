<h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
<p>
    This site was a challenge for me because visual design
    is not my strongest asset. For this reason I decided to deviate
    from all of my normal practices and use different techniques
    to improve my design skills.

    As of now, I am employed with Clark Associates as a PHP Developer.
    From this experience I hope to gain a better knowledge of PHP
    and the MVC Frameworks used with PHP.
